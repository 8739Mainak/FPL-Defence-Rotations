# FPL-Defence-Rotations

Created for Fantasy Premier League 2020-21, to find the best possible combination to rotate defenders in the team.

For eg; Out of 5 possible spots available for defenders, TAA had occupied one and I was left with a maximum selection of 4 defenders in the team.
So I had to find the best possible combination of 4 teams (preferably avoid LIV) such that at least 3 of them have good fixtures in terms of defending.

I've also added rotations of 4 to 2 playing in 11 in case you prefer 3-5-2 or 3-4-3.



DISCLAIMER: Personal Fixture Difficulty Rating Used

Created a [Difficulty Rating System Concept](https://github.com/priyanshux/FPL-Defence-Rotations/blob/master/FDR_Concept "FDR Concept for Defenders") specifically for defenders, so don't confuse or assume it to be an overall FDR. Difficulty against teams like SHU is considered to be pretty low since they don't score many goals (they scored 5th least number of goals last season, less than BOU who got relegated), so please keep this in mind. The final ratings till Gameweek 38 can be found [here](https://github.com/priyanshux/FPL-Defence-Rotations/blob/master/FPL_Defence_FDR.csv "Difficulty Ratings for Defenders").



The following are the results:
